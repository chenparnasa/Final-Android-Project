# Final-project
As a software engineering students, and as a researchers, we learned to ask the right questions to make theory to reality.         We used the software and technology to create a tool that can help to a big part of general population. The purpose of the project is to provide information for a person with movement disorders in their hands (or anyone who wants to be aware to the level of stability of his hands).                 The most common movement disorder is known as tremor, which can appear at rest, movement or static state. There are many causes of tremor, most tremors can aggravated by many reasons.                 "Today, medicine does not provide enough answers to what are the reasons for tremor in hands and moreover it does not check the level of tremor and what conditions increase the tremor for each person, therefore came up an idea for an app that gives the possibility to examine and estimate tremor level in various situations, also known as tremor amplifiers         The app will use a sensor accelerator that measures mobility and unique for Android.
